## About me
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am a doctoral candidate at Central European University in Vienna. I deal with questions in political psychology using experiments & other tools for causal inference. My dissertation investigates various aspects of political group behavior: the compound emotional and policy opinion effects of winning and losing elections, or the temporary effect of other group identity salience on partisan behavior such as affective polarization. My other projects look at the limits of citizen accountability on complex or controversial issues such as drug regulation or political scandals. I am a serious hobby cyclist. My academic hobby is reading about animal behavior.
