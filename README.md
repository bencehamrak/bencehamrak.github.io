## About me
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am a doctoral candidate at Central European University in Vienna. I deal with questions in political behavior and psychology using experiments & other tools for causal inference. My dissertation investigates the changes in the temporal salience of partisan group identity on out-group hostility and affective polarization. My other projects look at the limits of citizen accountability on complex or controversial issues such as drug regulation or political scandals. I am a serious hobby cyclist and I like to read about animal behavior.
