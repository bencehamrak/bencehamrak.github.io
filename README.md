## About me
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am a doctoral candidate at Central European University in Vienna and a research fellow at the University of Vienna. My dissertation examines how political institutions (e.g., elections) interact with group identities, such as partisanship and gender, through the lenses of affective polarization and group representation. Beyond this, I study how citizens form opinions on contentious or complex issues â€”like political scandals or drug regulationâ€” and how biases constrain democratic accountability. To address these questions, I primarily use surveys, survey experiments, and causal inference methods for observational data. When out of office, I am a serious hobby cyclist, and a nature and animal enthusiast.
